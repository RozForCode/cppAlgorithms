// q1 - kth smallest element

// q3 - sort a k sorted array or nearly sorted array

// q4- K closest numbers to a given value

// q5- Top K frequent numbers

// q6 Frequency sort

/*
Problem Statement: Frequency Sort (Heap Problem)
You are given an array of integers, and your task is to sort the array based on the frequency of each number.
The numbers with a higher frequency should come first. If two numbers have the same frequency, the number with the higher value
should come first. The goal is to return the array sorted according to these rules.

// q7 K -closed points to origin

// Given a list of points on a 2D plane, the task is to find the K closest points to the origin (0, 0). The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by the Euclidean distance formula:
// distance = sqrt(x1^2-x2^2 + y1^2-y2^2)
// for this question it'll be sqrt(x1^2+y1^2) as we are talking about origin

// q8 Connect Ropes to Minimise the Cost
/*
You are given multiple ropes with different lengths. Your task is to connect all the ropes into a single rope.
Each time you connect two ropes, the cost of connecting them is equal to the sum of their lengths.
You need to find the minimum cost required to connect all the ropes into one.

// q9 Sum of Elements between k1 smallest and k2 smallest numbers
/*
Given an array of integers and two integers k1 and k2, the task is to find
the sum of the elements between the k1-th smallest and the k2-th smallest numbers in the array.
