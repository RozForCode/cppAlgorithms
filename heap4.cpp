// q5- Top K frequent numbers
// initial thoughts- sounds like we have the find the largest frequency so min heap(we get rid of small ones) by storing pair
// priority_queue<pair<int,pair<int,int>,vector<int>,greater<int>

// from video - we have to use hash
// hashing -  hashing refers to the process of converting input data (like a string or number) into a fixed-size value, typically called a hash code or hash value. This is done using a hash function.4
// first I'll study about hash function, hash table, collision, and applucation of hashing
// then move onto the q5
