# cppAlgorithms
## This repo contains cpp code for various algorithms that are useful in solving leetcode problems.
My goal is also to include that best possible explanation of the working of these algorithms.

There are 3 algos that I plan on mastering
 1. sliding window
 2.DFS
 3.BFS

How I'll do them
1. Understand how and why a algo works
2. see solved solutions with that algo
3. solve problems that are solved using that algo
